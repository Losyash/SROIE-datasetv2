## Scanned receipts OCR and information extraction (SROIE)
This dataset was created for the ICDAR 2019 Robust Reading Challenge on Scanned Receipts OCR and Information Extraction (SROIE). The dataset has receipts written in English. It also contains the pre-trained base model LayoutLM, which I use to train the model to extract information from the SROIE dataset.
